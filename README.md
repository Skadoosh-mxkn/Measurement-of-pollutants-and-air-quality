# Computation distributed in pollutant measurements of the National Air Quality Information System

#### Introduction
In this project we will use distributed computing to work with open data on contaminant measurements and air quality information. The API we will work with contains a list of geographic information stations where pollutant measurements are obtained at each station, these data are updated every hour.
The API we will work with is created and shared openly by INECC, which is the national institute for ecology and climate change.
