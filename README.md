# Computation distributed in pollutant measurements of the National Air Quality Information System

#### definition of the project

In this project we will use distributed computing to work with open data on contaminant measurements and air quality information. The API contains a list of geographic information stations where pollutant measurements are obtained. These data are updated every hour.
The API is created and shared openly by INECC, which is the national institute for ecology and climate change.

#### Overall objective

The objective of this project is to collect data in real time from the National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change to model air quality and the amount of pollutants from different stations in the country, we want these data to be exposed to interested people through a web server, that is, use distributed computing in our data collection model.
