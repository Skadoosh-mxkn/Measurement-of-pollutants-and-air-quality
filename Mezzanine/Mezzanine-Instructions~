#----Creating a Mezzanine Project----#

$pip3 install mezzanine
$mezzanine-project <project name>
  -Creates the project
$cd <project name>
$emacs setting.py
        -Here, you can change some setting, like Regiom, Languaje or configure the database
	       -You´re configuratin Mezzanine
	-If you want a change, you have to configure local_settings.py too. local_settings.py file will be the main
	configuration file, so, if you make a setting on settings.py and you don´t configure local_settings.py
	the configuration would have no effect.
